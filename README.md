# Fibonacci-Phi
Finding the convergence point of Phi using Fibonacci niumbers.

Too much time on my hands?
Many, many years ago (1978)  a book called Secrets of the Great Pyramid was published by Peter Tompkins. In the book, the author claims that the Egyptians had no knowledge of Pi but instead, used Phi (the Golden Section). Both Pi and Phi are irrational numbers but an interesting point is that division of two adjacent Fibonacci numbers (larger/smaller) results in a good approximation of Phi, To know more about Phi, here is a good article https://www.livescience.com/37704-phi-golden-ratio.html. Also https://www.goldennumber.net/phi-pi-great-pyramid-egypt/ which indicates that Phi can approximate Pi to within 0.1%.

I wondered at which Fibonacci numbers did the precision of Phi exceed the precision of simple computyati0on, hence this simple C# solution.
